# midterm
For this midterm project, I chose to use the TextBlob package because of the polarity feature. This feature analyzes whether or not a statement is negative, positive or neutral. To install TextBlob I initally installed the 'pip install -U textblob' and 'python -m textblob.download_corpora' in a virtual environment. For the code to run, TextBlob needs to be imported directly into the project. In lines 9 through 11 I displayed my comprehension of docstrings and functions. Then in lines 13 and 14, I featured the location of where the doctring will be used. Followed by the else if loop for the statement in lines 18 through 23. Those lines determined whether or not the statement will be negative, positive or neutral under certain circumstances and constraints. For the final project idea, I would possibly use TextBlob and utilize the classification, speech tagging or translation feature. The code you'd want to run is the midterm.py code.
